*0. JavaScript operators are used to assign values, compare values, perform arithmetic operations, and more.
*/
//1. Assignment operators
/*
=	  x = y	  x = y	
+=	x += y	x = x + y		
-=	x -= y	x = x - y	
*=	x *= y	x = x * y		
/=	x /= y	x = x / y		
%=	x %= y	x = x % y
*/
/*
*you use assignment operators are used to assign values to JavaScript variables.
*ussaully when you are operating on the varaible
*/
//2. Arithmetic operators
/*Operator    Description     Example	    Result in y	    Result in x
   +	        Addition 	    x = y + 2	   y = 5	       x = 7
   -	       Subtraction	    x = y - 2	   y = 5	       x = 3
   *	       Multiplication	x = y * 2	   y = 5	       x = 10
   /	       Division	        x = y / 2	   y = 5	       x = 2.5
   %	       Remainder 	    x = y % 2	   y = 5	       x = 1
   ++	       Increment	    x = ++y	       y = 6	       x = 6
   --	       Decrement	    x = --y	       y = 4	       x = 4

/*
*Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic between variables and/or values.
*/
//3. Comparison operators
/*Operator	Description
  ==	     equal to
  ===	  stricly equal to
  !=	    not equal
  !===    stricly not equal to
  >	        greater than
  <	        less than
  >=	greater than or equal to
  <=	less than or equal to

/*
*Comparison operators are used in logical statements to determine equality or difference between variables or values.
*/
//4. Logical Operators 
/*Operator	Description
&&	            and
||	            or
!	            not
*/
/*
*Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values.
*/
//5. Unary operators
/*Operator    Description
delete        delete
*/
/*
*The delete operator deletes an object, an object's property, or an element at a specified index in an array.
*/ 
//Tenary operator 
variablename = (condition) ? value1:value2 //syntax
drinkable = (age < 21) ? "Too young":"Old enough"; //example
//Example explained: If the variable "age" is a value below 21, the value of the variable "drinkable" will be "Too young", otherwise the value of drinkable will be "Old enough".
